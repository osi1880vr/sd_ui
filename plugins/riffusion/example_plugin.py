"""This is an example plugin file that you can use to build your own plugins for aiPixels.

Welcome to aiPixels. Please refer to PySide 6.4 documentation for UI functions.

Please also note the following features at your disposal by default:
DeforumSix
Hypernetworks
Singleton

at plugin loading time, the plugins initme function will be called automatically to make sure that
all defaults are set correctly, and that your new UI element is loaded, with its signals and slots connected.

Your plugin's parent is the MainWindow, and by default, it has a canvas loaded. You can access all of its functions,
such as addrect_atpos, and image_preview_func (make sure to set self.parent.image before doing so).

It is good to know, that if you are doing heavy lifting, you have to use its own QThreadPool, otherwise your gui freezes
while processing. To do so, just use the worker from backend.worker

        worker = Worker(self.parent.deforum_ui.run_deforum_six_txt2img)
        self.parent.threadpool.start(worker)

It is also worth mentioning, that ui should only be modified from the main thread, therefore when displaying an image,
set self.parent.image, then call self.parent.image_preview_signal, which will emit a signal to call
the image_preview_func from the main thread.
